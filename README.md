# Dialog system

In this small project i made an dialog system with a version of a tree algorithem.
it's a very small game so dont expect much from it.

## Features
These are some features in this game

- [Tree Algorithem (sort of)](link)
- [dialog texts](link)

## Software Analysis 
i chose to work with unity because i have the most experience with this Game Engine and becouse i wanted to learn 
some other thing within c#. I think it was best for me to use unity because it has been a while since i used unity
so i wanted to freshen up y unity skills again.

## Learning Goals 
What i wanted to learn in this project
- Tree algorithem
- Refresh my unity skills
- Working with dictionary's
